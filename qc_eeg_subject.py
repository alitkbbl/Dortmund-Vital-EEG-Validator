qc_eeg_subject.py - first-pass SCREENING (triage) of the resting-state EEG of ONE OR MANY subjects
OpenNeuro ds005385 (Dortmund Vital Study), dataset version 1.0.3
==========================================================================

Goal: keep every healthy, usable recording and throw away only the catastrophic, unsalvageable ones.

Which subjects?  Type numbers only (no "sub-" needed):
    python qc_eeg_subject.py                  # asks which subjects
    python qc_eeg_subject.py 18               # one subject
    python qc_eeg_subject.py 1 2 3            # several subjects, separated by spaces
    python qc_eeg_subject.py 1 to 20          # a range
    python qc_eeg_subject.py 1 5 to 8 12      # mixed: 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12
The same text can be typed when the script asks "Subjects >".

What happens for every subject
------------------------------
1. Eligibility (embedded participant table; nothing is downloaded yet):
       * age > 60                         -> REJECTED
       * late triggers > 0 (any session)  -> REJECTED
       * only session 1 completed         -> fine, only ses-1 (4 recordings) is analysed
   If the subject was already analysed with the same QC logic and thresholds, the earlier results are reused:
   nothing is downloaded and nothing is analysed again (--force-reanalysis overrides this).
2. Download of exactly the needed files (DataLad like the manual workflow; plain HTTPS as fallback).
   Files that are already on disk are not downloaded again.
3. QC layers on every recording that exists (a missing recording is reported as MISSING):
       header / metadata - channel integrity (flat, clipped, noisy, spatially uncorrelated, frozen) -
       amplitude - spectral validation (alpha, 50 Hz, dead spectrum) - consistency.
   Voltage statistics use a baseline-corrected copy of the signal (0.5 Hz high-pass, in memory only).
4. Tables, figures (A-G, channel quality topomap), report and run manifest.
5. Clean-up: the analysed data are deleted (data folder + DataLad copy) to save disk space (--keep-data keeps them).

Screening rules (all thresholds are in CONFIG below)
----------------------------------------------------
    FAIL only for catastrophic problems:
        * 2 or more critical channels bad (Cz, Fz, Pz, O1, O2; e.g. both O1 and O2)
        * more than 6 bad channels in total (too many to interpolate)
        * dead spectrum on O1/O2/Oz, recording shorter than 1 min, wrong scale, frozen recording,
          unreadable file, metadata errors, 50 Hz noise together with clipping of half of the channels
    FLAG (kept, but worth a look): weak alpha / no alpha blocking (alpha non-responders are healthy),
        50 Hz line noise (HIGH_LINE_NOISE above 30 dB: a notch filter removes it), one bad critical channel, ...
    PASS with label USABLE_NEEDS_INTERPOLATION: 1-6 bad channels, at most one of them critical.
    Per recording: label USABLE | USABLE_WITH_FLAGS | USABLE_NEEDS_INTERPOLATION | REJECT, plus reason codes.
    Per subject: the most demanding label, or PARTIALLY_USABLE when some recordings are usable and others rejected.

Where the results go (default --out-root qc_output)
---------------------------------------------------
    qc_output/
        summary_all_subjects.xlsx     ALL subjects in one Excel file (sheets: Subjects, Recordings, Issues, Legend),
        summary_all_subjects.csv      the same Subjects sheet as csv; both are updated after EVERY subject
        sub-018/
            status.txt                the whole story of this subject in plain text (also for rejected ones)
            status.json               the same, machine-readable
            qc_results/               tables (csv), figures/, qc_report.txt, run_manifest.json, run_log.txt
        sub-002/
            status.txt                e.g. "REJECTED: Age above 60 (67)"   (no qc_results folder, nothing downloaded)
        ...
    The channel quality topomap is  qc_results/figures/sub-<ID>_task-rest_channel_quality_topomap.png

A problem in one subject never stops the others: it is written into that subject's status file.
Press Ctrl+C (or lose the connection, or crash) at any time: every finished subject is already saved. Run the SAME
command again and the finished subjects are skipped automatically; only the rest is done. If the download fails for
3 subjects in a row the batch stops by itself (--stop-after-failures) and tells you how to continue.

Other options
-------------
    --data-dir data  --repo-dir ds005385_repo  --out-root qc_output
    --no-download            use the EDF files that are already in the data folder (they are never deleted)
    --keep-data              do not delete the downloaded data after the analysis
    --force-reanalysis       analyse again even if results of the same QC version exist
    --stop-after-failures N  stop after N subjects in a row whose download failed (default 3, 0 = never)
    --force-download         download again even if the files are on disk
    --verify-table FILE.tsv  compare the embedded participant table with your sheet (TSV) and exit
    --debug                  show the full traceback and stop at the first problem

Requirements
------------
    pip install "mne>=1.6" edfio numpy scipy pandas matplotlib openpyxl
    DataLad + git-annex (recommended; same as the manual workflow)

Exit codes: 0 = everything finished, 1 = a technical problem (error, no data, Ctrl+C),
            2 = invalid input, or every requested subject was rejected.

Nothing is ever written into the raw data. Signals are only filtered/detrended in memory
for statistics. All thresholds are in CONFIG below.
